The model was trained over the course of 20 epochs. The training duration exceeded initial expectations. 
To address this issue, early stopping was applied to optimize the training process.
During training, the model’s accuracy increased significantly—from 81.6% at the beginning to 91.5% in the final epoch.
The validation accuracy also improved, rising from 83.3% to 88.4%.
These results indicate that the model fit the training data well and was able to generalize effectively to the validation data.
Additionally, the loss value decreased substantially throughout the training. 
The training loss dropped from 0.4071 to 0.2062 by the 20th epoch, while the validation loss decreased from 0.3968 to 0.3361.
These improvements demonstrate that both the accuracy and loss of the model were successfully optimized during training.
