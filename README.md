#  Project Overview 
** This project applies an end-to-end deep learning pipeline to detect and segment brain strokes from medical images (CT/MRI). By combining image processing with a binary classification model (EfficientNet-B0) and a segmentation model (U-Net), the system highlights lesion areas to assist radiologists in early diagnosis **
